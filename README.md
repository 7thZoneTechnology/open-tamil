Open Source Tamil Tools

Goals
=====
Goal of this package is to collect and develop open-source licensed Tamil tools, in one location that provide the following,

1. Unicode standard tools for Tamil - provide various tools for Tamil Unicode development
2. Access Unicode Tamil letters, vowels and consonants.
3. Breakdown Tamil glyphs and unicode code-points into Tamil letter representations - collation
4. Tools for navigating a corpus of data, build word frequency, prediction tables etc.
5. Conversion from various encodings. e.g. TSCII to Unicode etc.

While most of tools in this package will be in Python 2.6. or later, I am open to other open-source language source code contributions.
