Open Source Tamil Tools

==Goals==
Goal of this package is to collect and develop open-source licensed Tamil tools, in one location that provide the following,

# Unicode standard for Tamil - provide various tools for Tamil Unicode development
# Access Unicode Tamil letters, vowels and consonants.
# Breakdown Tamil glyphs and unicode code-points into Tamil letter representations - collation
# Tools for navigating a corpus of data, build word frequency, prediction tables etc.
# Conversion from various encodings. e.g. TSCII to Unicode etc.

While most of tools in this package will be in Python 2.6. or later, I am open to other open-source language source code contributions.

==About==
Tamil is classical language primarily spoken in South India.
